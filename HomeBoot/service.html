            <h3>Key aims of the project</h3>
            The project is being carried out in two Phases.

            Phase I of the project would computerize the existing system using Internet technology and provide on-line transfer of information, processing of information with least human interface and bring quality action oriented outputs.
            
            The Phase II of project will commence with the review of the systems of monitoring Programme/Project Planning, Implementation and Performance Management of Infrastructure in Public and Private Sector. The interfaces with concerned administrative ministries/project authorities and stakeholders/user agency viz. Prime Minister’s Office, Cabinet Secretariat, Planning Commission and the concerned administrative Ministries would also be studied. Based on the review the consultants will recommend the necessary changes in the system, organization and suggest improvement in the adopted IT strategy.

            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            To facilitate the online capturing of information from project executing agencies and nodal ministries, a MOS&PI Extranet is set up. This Extranet is implemented through Programme Implementation Wing website. As a project executing agency, you are a partner in Projects and will be able to access the MOS&PI extranet, which could be through any Internet enabled computer from your office. All information being entered by a partner in web-enabled forms will be sent online and received by concerned MOS&PI officer through a secure tunnel.
